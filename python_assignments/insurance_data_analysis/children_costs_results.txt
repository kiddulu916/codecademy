Analysis Explanation:
- The table above shows the total and average insurance costs for each group based on the number of children.
- The 'diff_from_prev' column shows how much the average insurance cost changes as the number of children increases by one.
- The 'pct_change_from_prev' column shows the percentage change in average cost from the previous group.

Interpretation:
- If the differences are consistently positive and large, it suggests insurance costs rise with more children. If differences are small or fluctuate, the relationship may be weak or non-linear.
- Large jumps in certain groups may indicate thresholds where insurers increase rates more steeply.
- If some groups show a decrease, it could suggest other factors are at play, or possible discounts for larger families.
- This analysis helps identify trends and patterns that may not be obvious from overall averages alone.
